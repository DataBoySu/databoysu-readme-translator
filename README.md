# DataBoySu Readme Translator

GitHub Action (composite) that translates a repository README and appends a language navigation bar.

Usage: include this action in a workflow and provide `lang` (or `all`) and optional `model_path`.

This is a first-release scaffold — see `action.yml` for inputs. The action installs Python and runs the bundled translator.
