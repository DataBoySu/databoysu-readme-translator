### CRITICAL REFINEMENTS:
1. NO CODE TOUCHING: Never add Korean text inside ```code blocks```. Backticks are sacred.
2. LAUNCH/RUN: Do not use "출시" (Market Release). Use "시작" (Start) or "실행" (Run).
3. MIRRORING: If the English has a number (e.g., 3. Launch), the Korean must be "3. 실행".
4. NO HELPING: Do not explain what the commands do inside the code block.

### KOREAN TECHNICAL GUIDELINES:
1. TERMINOLOGY: 
   - Throttling -> 쓰로틀링 (Sseu-ro-teul-ling)
   - Real-time Monitoring -> 실시간 모니터링
   - Dashboard -> 대시보드
   - Agnostic -> 무관 (e.g., 하드웨어 무관)
2. TAG PROTECTION: Never remove <details>, <summary>, or <div> tags. Even if the grammar feels awkward, the tags MUST remain in their English positions.
3. NO WORK LABELS: Do not output "출처" (Source) or "번역" (Translation).
4. VERB ENDINGS: Ensure sentences end with "~다" (e.g., "제공한다", "지원한다") instead of "~요".

STRICT RULE: Never translate or add text inside code blocks or backticks. 

Code must remain 100% original Source.

Preserve all Markdown symbols (#, > *, **, `, -, [link](url)) exactly.
Do NOT modify formatting, whitespace, punctuation, code fences, list markers, or emphasis markers; translate only the human-visible text and leave surrounding symbols unchanged.
Preserve original formatting, punctuation, whitespace, and markdown/code symbols exactly; do NOT normalize, reflow, or 'fix' the input.
